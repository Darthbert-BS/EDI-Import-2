Notes for project EDI Import.

ALDI-V2 Implementation (2022/2023) requires changes to some EDI elements.






[if].[EDIDetailInsert]

Stored Proc : [if].[EDIHeaderUpdateTotals]

[Custom].[if].[SORTOI_EDIHeader]

[if].[EDIHeaderInsert]
[if].[EDIDetailInsert]




Stored procedure to create the header --- including the Requested Delivery Date.


This means the EDIImport program may need to call multiple EDIHeaderInserts ...

How ?

REQUESTED DELIVERY DATE ===> REQDD


If the REQDD is visible in the DETAIL records ....  and there are multiple RDDs .... then we need to treat like
seperate files.... somehow.


Maybe a pre-parser that looks at the file and determins how man REQDDs there are.

Loop

The when processing the file,  filter only the REQDD passed in 




For example :  importer.Import(fileEntries, DFMID, Company)    ==>   importer.Import(fileEntries, DFMID, Company,  RequestedDeliveryDate);


new method to get a list of REQDDs   



Actually ...

LoadEDItoTable(fileName, _dbc, _dbt, dFmid, company)  ==>  LoadEDItoTable(fileName, _dbc, _dbt, dFmid, company, RequestedDeliveryDate )

May need to know if it is a header REQDD or LINEREQDD


-------

Pre-Processor.....

Scan the InputFileLocation reading each file... determine 

IF  file a Header REQDD
	move to intermediate-processing-folder
ELSE
	Foreach Line REQDD
		write a new file grouped by the REQDD 
		New file has formated with Header REQDD
	END LOOP
END IF
